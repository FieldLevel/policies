# **FieldLevel, Inc. Terms of Service**

Revised: September 17, 2025

**These Terms of Service contain an arbitration provision. Please review the Arbitration section for details.**

These Terms of Service ("**_Terms_**") govern your use of our websites, mobile apps, and other platforms on which these Terms appear (collectively, the "**_Site_**") and related services ("**_Services_**"). FieldLevel, Inc. ("**FieldLevel,**" "**_we_**" or "**_us_**" or **"our"**) provides the Site and Services. "**_You_**" refers to you as a user of the Site or Services.

BY USING THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.

1. **Eligibility**

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Site or the Services. If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (a "Minor"), you must use the Service only with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. FieldLevel will obtain such consent directly from the parent or guardian. By allowing a Minor to use the Service, the parent or guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms and to indemnify and hold harmless FieldLevel for any breach of these Terms by the Minor.

If you are registering on behalf of a business or entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. If you are not authorized, you assume sole personal liability for all obligations under these Terms.

2. **Additional Terms**

Some of our Services (e.g., write-ups) have additional terms and conditions ("**_Additional Terms_**"). Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, we will make them available for you to read through your use of that Service. By using that Service, you agree to the Additional Terms.

3. **Acceptable Use of the Site and Services**

You are responsible for your use of the Site and Services, and for any use of the Site or Services made using your account. Our goal is to create a positive, useful, and safe user experience.

4. **Accounts; Passwords**

If a particular feature or service offered on the Site requires you to open an account, you must complete the specified registration process – including those that may be hosted or provided by third parties \- by providing us with current, complete, and accurate information as requested by the applicable online registration form. It is your responsibility to maintain the currency, completeness, and accuracy of your registration data and any loss caused by your failure to do so is your responsibility. During account creation you may be asked to provide your email address or choose a password. It is entirely your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password and account. Additionally, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. You further agree not to email, post, or otherwise disseminate any user ID, password, or other information that provides you access to the Site. FieldLevel is not liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. Even where account creation or service use involves third-party platforms, these Terms and our Privacy Policy shall take precedence over any terms, policies, or agreements presented by such third parties with respect to your use of the Site.

You agree not to create or use more than one personal account for your own use at any given time. You may not create an Account for anyone other than yourself, except that parents or guardians who have affirmatively agreed to these Terms on behalf of a minor child may create an Account for such minor child. FieldLevel reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account(s) if you violate this limitation.

You may be asked to create a username in connection with your Account. FieldLevel reserves the right to remove or reclaim any username at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to claims by a third party that a username violates that third party's rights, or if FieldLevel considers your username or password insecure, inappropriate, or otherwise inconsistent with our policies.

FieldLevel reserves the right to limit the number of connections, groups, or other features a user may have or access, and to otherwise restrict, suspend, or terminate access in its sole discretion.

5. **Subscriptions; Payments; and Cancellations**

(a) Subscriptions. By registering for an Account, you obtain access to the Service. Each Account and the rights and privileges provided therein is personal and non-transferable. Paid Subscriptions ("Subscriptions") are available and may include premium and/or additional features and services not available to free Accounts. FieldLevel reserves the right to change prices for Subscriptions at any time, and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of promotions or price decreases. Your Subscription is valid for a specific period ("Subscription Term"), as selected at the time of purchase.

(b) Payments. If you purchase any Services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or on a recurring Subscription basis, you agree and consent to FieldLevel's use of third-party payment providers for billing and processing online payments, and you agree to pay the applicable fees for the Services (including, without limitation, periodic fees Subscriptions) as they become due, plus all related taxes.

If you do not pay on time or if FieldLevel cannot charge your payment method for any reason, FieldLevel reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Service and Account, and to terminate these Terms. You expressly agree that FieldLevel is permitted to bill you for any applicable fees, any applicable tax, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services, and the fees will be billed to the payment method designated on your registration with the Service and, if applicable, thereafter at regular intervals for the remainder of your Subscription Term. By providing a payment method, You expressly authorize FieldLevel to charge said payment method at regular intervals, according to Your Subscription. If you have a balance due on any Account Subscription, you agree that FieldLevel may charge such unpaid fees to your payment method or otherwise bill you for such unpaid fees.

(c) Automatic Renewal Terms: To ensure uninterrupted Services, all paid subscriptions are automatically renewed. Each renewal(s) will be for the same period of time as the original Subscription Term, unless otherwise agreed between you and FieldLevel. At renewal, FieldLevel will charge your Account the applicable Subscription fee and any applicable sales or similar taxes, unless you cancel prior to the recurring renewal date. Subject to Section 5(d) below, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME; HOWEVER, ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEES CHARGED PRIOR TO CANCELLATION WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART. If you cancel your Subscription, your access to and use of the service will be shut off once your then-current pre-paid Subscription Term expires.

FieldLevel reserves the right to modify pricing at any time (but not the price in effect for your then-current Subscription Term), upon advance notice to you. If you do not cancel your Subscription or turn off the auto-renewal function within the period specified after receiving notice of a price change, your Subscription will renew at the new price indicated in your notice.

(d) Cancellation Terms: You may cancel your Subscription at any time, and such cancellation shall become effective upon expiration of your then-current Subscription Term. You may cancel or suspend your Subscription by going to Account settings directly from your profile. You agree and understand that you will be charged Subscription fees until the expiration of your then-current Subscription Term and Subscription fees will not be refunded, in whole or in part unless required by law. You will not be eligible for a pro-rated refund of any portion of the Subscription fees paid for any unused days of the then-current Subscription Term. If you have any problems or concerns with your cancellation, please contact us at support@fieldlevel.com for assistance.

6. **User Content and Feedback**

The Site and some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send, or receive content and data ("**_User Content_**"). You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that User Content.

When you upload, submit, store, send, or receive User Content to or through the Site or Services, you give us permission to reproduce and use your User Content as follows: you grant to us and those we work with a license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as adaptations, or other changes we make so that User Content works better with Services) of your User Content. This license extends to any lawful purpose, including without limitation for providing the Site and Services to you or for commercialization without any further consent, notice or compensation to you or any third parties. Our license to your User Content is non-exclusive, meaning you may use the User Content for your own purposes or let others use your User Content for their purposes. This license is fully-paid and royalty free, meaning we do not owe you anything else in connection with our use of your User Content. This license is perpetual, meaning our right to use your User Content survives our relationship with you. This license is fully transferrable and sublicensable, meaning we can let others use it. We may exercise our rights under this license anywhere in the world and in any media.

You promise that:

- you own all rights to your User Content or, alternatively, that you have the right to give us the rights described above; and

- your User Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party.

We may refuse to accept or transmit User Content for any reason.

When you publicly share User Content through the Services, you also grant the right for others to use it. You may delete your User Content or ask us to delete it, but if you have shared it with others, they may still have copies. Any User Content you submit is at your own risk, and publicly shared content is not confidential.

By submitting feedback, suggestions, or using any rating feature, you hereby assign FieldLevel all right, title, and interest in such feedback and ratings, and agree that FieldLevel is free to use them for any purpose without attribution or compensation to you.

FieldLevel Copyright Agent

[support@fieldlevel.com](mailto:support@fieldlevel.com)

For clarity, only copyright infringement notices should go to our Copyright Agent. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section your notice may not be valid.

If you believe the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, you may submit a counter-notice to the address listed above containing the following information:

- Your physical or electronic signature;

- Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or a misidentification of the content; and

- Your name, physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of: (1) if such physical address is in the United States, the federal court in which your address is located; or (2) if your physical address is outside of the United States, a federal court in California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed or disabled. If we receive such a notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.

9. **Enforcement**

13. **Mobile Application**

16. **Disclaimer and Limitations on Our Liability**

YOU USE THE SITE AND SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS ("**_AFFILIATES_**") DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND THOSE ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

IN PARTICULAR, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES, OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR ONLINE SERVICES LINKED TO OR INTEGRATED WITH THE SITE OR SERVICES. OUR COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY: (A) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (b) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES; (c) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR USER DATA; (d) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES; (e) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (f) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED OR SHARED THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY MATERIAL OR INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM DOING SO. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA) OR FOR THE COST OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'VE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID US DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

You understand and agree that we have set our prices and entered into these Terms with you in reliance upon the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms, which allocate risk between us and form the basis of a bargain between the parties.

17. **Indemnification**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless our company and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and legal costs) of any kind or nature, arising from or relating to, any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties or obligations under these Terms by you or anyone using your account. If we assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.

18. **Informal Dispute Resolution**

We try to address any disputes without the need to initiate a formal legal case. You agree that prior to submitting any dispute or claim to arbitration for resolution, you and we agree to make a good faith effort to resolve it informally, including having at least one telephone or videoconference conversation between you, personally, and us. To initiate this good faith effort to informally resolve a dispute, you agree to notify us in writing by email at support@fieldlevel.com of the nature of the dispute, the basis for your claims and the resolution that you are seeking, including any monetary amount, with as much detail as you can provide so that we can gain a sufficient understanding of the dispute. Within the sixty (60) days following our receipt of this notice, you agree to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the dispute, including personally participating in a telephone call or videoconference with us. You may have a lawyer attend the call with you if you wish. If the dispute is not resolved within that sixty (60) days (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you or we may commence proceedings as set out in these Terms to resolve the dispute consistent with the process set forth below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to commencing an arbitration. You and we agree to toll any applicable statute of limitations and filing fee deadlines while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process from the date we receive your notice to the date an action is commenced or the conclusion of the 60-day period described above, whichever is sooner. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration.

19. **Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights**

You and FieldLevel agree that, except as set forth below, we will resolve any controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes between you and FieldLevel or you and a third-party agent of FieldLevel (a "Claim") through final and binding arbitration instead of through court proceedings in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). This arbitration agreement applies to any existing or future Claims that you have not individually filed in a court of law or in arbitration prior to the date you agreed to these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. A court of competent jurisdiction has exclusive authority to determine the existence, scope, and validity of the arbitration agreement and the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim, including, without limitation, whether any conditions precedent to the commencement of an arbitration have been completely satisfied and any objections with respect to any of the foregoing.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send us an individual letter signed by you requesting arbitration and describing your claim at 1700 Aviara Parkway \#130994, Carlsbad, CA 92013\. This letter must be sent at least ten (10) business days before you initiate an arbitration proceeding against us.

Any party to the arbitration may at any time serve an offer of compromise in writing upon any other party to the action. Offers of compromise pursuant to these Terms will be adjudicated and interpreted in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 998\.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, FieldLevel will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or FieldLevel from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and FieldLevel also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court or transfer qualifying claims to small claims court. Either party may elect that a Claim be filed exclusively in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction by providing notice to the other party. In the event a Claim has already been filed in arbitration, the party who has filed that Claim will, within ten (10) business days of receiving such a notice, withdraw their Claim from arbitration. The parties will then proceed with the Claim exclusively in small claims court. A party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this paragraph. In addition, you and FieldLevel retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions. Any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.

Neither you nor FieldLevel may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. You may not bring Claims in arbitration on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or FieldLevel's individual Claims.

If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and FieldLevel each waive any right to a jury trial. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a "public injunction" and any such "public injunction" may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either party seeks a "public injunction," all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first, and any prayer or claim for a "public injunction" in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party's claim or prayer for "public injunctive relief." In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

This Arbitration Agreement Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with FieldLevel.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR FIELDLEVEL WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

20. **Mass Arbitration Process Requirements**

If twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against FieldLevel at or around the same time by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (and your Claim is one such claim) (a "Mass Arbitration"), you understand and agree that the resolution of your Claim might be delayed. You also agree to the following process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule and Supplementary Rules. Regardless of the provisions in the arbitration agreement above about the prohibitive costs of individual arbitration for you, if your lawyer or their business partner (each a "Third Party Funder") is directly or indirectly paying or advancing the arbitration fees and costs in a Mass Arbitration on your behalf, the Process Arbitrator shall have discretion to determine whether the total arbitration fees and costs due to AAA should be split evenly between the Third Party Funder(s), on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. The Process Arbitrator shall make or confirm this discretionary decision before the initiation of each batch, as set out below. In the final decision, the arbitrator can reevaluate and divide the arbitration fees and costs among the Third Party Funder(s) and us in amounts they see fit to ensure a fair division among the parties. Additionally, when permitted under applicable rules, you may be responsible for our arbitration fees and costs.

Twenty (20) claims shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a first batching process, ten (10) of which will be selected by the claimants and ten (10) of which will be selected by FieldLevel. The remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, the parties shall participate in a global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge, for which FieldLevel will pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims through mediation at this time, then forty (40) claims shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second batching process, twenty (20) of which will be selected by the claimants and twenty (20) of which will be selected by FieldLevel. (If there are fewer than forty (40) claims remaining, all shall proceed.) The remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein. In any batching process, a single arbitrator shall preside over each proceeding, and only one proceeding may be assigned to each arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims after the conclusion of the forty (40) proceedings, the parties shall participate in another global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge, for which FieldLevel will pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims in mediation at this time, this staged process shall continue with no more than one hundred (100) claims proceeding at any time in a staged order that is selected randomly or by the AAA, until all the coordinated claims, including your Claim, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. At any time during these proceedings, we agree to participate in a global mediation session should your counsel request it in an effort to resolve all remaining claims. Any applicable statute of limitations on your Claims and filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this section regarding "Mass Arbitration Process Requirements" from the time claims are selected for the first set of batching proceedings until the time your Claim is selected to proceed in arbitration, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this section regarding "Mass Arbitration Process Requirements" and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against FieldLevel. Should a court of competent jurisdiction decline to enforce these "Mass Arbitration Process Requirements," you and we agree that your and our counsel shall engage in good faith and with the assistance of a Process Arbitrator to devise and implement procedures that ensure that arbitration remains efficient and cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the AAA to address reductions in arbitration fees.

21. **Other Provisions**

Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

Except as otherwise described in these Terms, these Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.

To the extent any action relating to the Site, Services, or any transaction with FieldLevel is not required to be arbitrated or filed in small claims court in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement, such action must be brought in the federal and state courts located within California, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.

All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination or expiration shall so survive, including but not limited to ownership, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability

The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.

We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.
