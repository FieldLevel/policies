### **Categories of Third Parties We Share Personal Information With**

**Service Providers.** From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe are trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("**Service Providers**"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and payment processing. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us.

**Marketing/Analytics/Advertising Partners.** We may share personal information with third-party marketing, analytics, or advertising partners, including social media platforms and networks, who provide analytics or marketing and advertising services to us.

**Corporate Transactions.** If our Company is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, it will result in the handling of your Personal Information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.

**Third Parties to Provide Services.** We may share personal information with a third party if you specifically authorize it, or it is required in order to complete a transaction, service, or activity that you initiated or requested, for example, with our payment processing providers. It includes where our Services provide visibility to other parties. Note: In such case, the collection and processing of your Personal Information will be subject to the privacy policy of such third party.

**Advertising Partners for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising.** We may share information with third parties in order to provide cross-contextual behavioral advertising. This may include the following categories of Personal Information: other identifying information, geolocation information, and internet and other electronic activity.

**Individuals that View Your Profile.** Certain profile information, including but not limited to a user's name, positions, recruiting class, and teams, may be shared publicly by default and can be accessible to other users of FieldLevel Services as well as publicly available and searchable through external search engines or similar technology. This information may be disclosed to other users of the Service and may also be indexed by third-party search engines and related technology.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.** We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of our company or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

### **Cookies**

We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and web browser) and may use anonymous identifiers (a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie). We use cookies and other similar technologies to analyze use of and improve the Site and Services, and as described in the Advertising and Online Tracking section of this Privacy Policy. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can manage which cookies we collect, or opt out of certain cookies by clicking on the modal shown when you open this page. You can also reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers (defined below) may use their own cookies, anonymous identifiers, or other tracking technology in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

We use third-party data analytics tools to analyze how users use the App and Services. For example, we use Google Analytics on the Site and Services to analyze how users use the Site and Services. For more information about how to opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics, visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

**_Options you make are device-specific and browser-specific._**

**Chat Technology.** We use chat technology to help provide customer service and support, which may include connecting with a live person (live chat), the use of a virtual assistant, or other automated process (chatbot). A chatbot is a software application that mimics human conversations in text or voice interactions on our website or through our customer service hotline. It enables the communication between a human and a machine, which can take the form of messages or voice commands. The chatbot is designed to work without the assistance of a human operator. It responds to questions posed to it in natural language as if it were a real person using a combination of pre-programmed scripts and machine learning algorithms. When asked a question, the chatbot will answer using the knowledge database that is currently available to it. If the conversation introduces a concept it isn't programmed to understand, it will pass it to a human operator. If you use our chat service, whether through a live chat or a chatbot, we will collect any Personal Information you provide to us. We will also create and store a transcript of your chat interaction with us, which will be shared with and stored by our third-party service provider. We use these transcripts and the information you provide for quality control, customer service, fraud prevention, and security.

**Advertising and Online Tracking.** We may place advertisements and allow third-party companies to serve ads and collect certain information when you visit the Site and Services. These companies may use certain information (e.g., click stream information, web browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie to collect this information. Our systems do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, but several of our Service Providers who utilize these cookies on our Site enable you to opt out of targeted advertising practices. To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org) or [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us. You can learn about this in the "Managing Your Information Preferences" section of this Privacy Policy.

Some browsers or browser extensions also allow you to tell websites not to share your information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising through the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. We will respond to this signal in a frictionless manner. If you configure this setting on your browser, certain features on our site may not work and you will receive less targeted advertising.

**_Options you make are device-specific and browser-specific._**

Regarding the transfer of Personal Information to countries outside the European Economic Area, UK, or Switzerland, we have entered, or will enter, into so-called "Standard Contractual Clauses" approved by the Commission of the European Union for international transfer of personal information to controllers or processors established in third counties as the case may be, when appropriate.

Our principle is that we will delete your Personal Information when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.

**Exercising Your Rights**:

To exercise your rights, submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

- Calling us toll-free at 888-908-7124; or

- Email us at support@fieldlevel.com.

Your verifiable consumer request must:

- Provide sufficient identifying information (including full name and email address) to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected and retained Personal Information, and/or your authority to make such a request on behalf of the data subject, and

- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Note that we will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request or to review and comply with the request.

You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a request on your behalf. Due to the sensitivity of such requests, you must verify the agent's authorization before we will act. Accordingly:

- You or your agent must supply proof that the agent is registered with the Secretary of State to act on your behalf; or

- You or your agent must supply other written permission for a specific agent to act on your behalf; and

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm with a level of confidence appropriate to the sensitivity of the information that the Personal Information we have collected and retained in our systems and databases relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have an account with us, we may require you to log-in to such account in order to verify your identity or authority or to provide or delete your information.
