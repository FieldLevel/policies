**FieldLevel, Inc. Copyright Policy**

Last Updated: July 22, 2020

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and encourage You to do the same. Accordingly, We have a policy of removing Submissions that violate intellectual property rights of others, suspending access to the Service (or any portion thereof) to any user who uses the Service in violation of someone's intellectual property rights, and/or terminating in appropriate circumstances the account of any user who uses the Service in violation of someone's intellectual property rights.

_Submitting a DMCA infringement notification_

Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") 17 U.S. Code § 512, we have implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed copyright infringement and for processing such claims in accordance with such law. If You believe Your copyright or other intellectual property right is being infringed by a user of the Service, please provide written notice to Our Agent for notice of claims of infringement: Attn: FieldLevel DMCA Agent. By Email: [support@fieldlevel.com](mailto:support@fieldlevel.com). By Mail: 1700 Aviara Parkway #130994, Carlsbad, CA 92013, USA.

To be sure the matter is handled immediately, Your written notice must:

-   Contain Your physical or electronic signature;

-   Identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property alleged to have been infringed;

-   Identify the allegedly infringing material in a sufficiently precise manner to allow Us to locate that material;

-   Contain adequate information by which We can contact You (including postal address, telephone number, and e-mail address);

-   Contain a statement that You have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material or other intellectual property is not authorized by the owner, the owner's agent or the law;

-   Contain a statement that the information in the written notice is accurate; and

-   Contain statement, under penalty of perjury, that You are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright or other intellectual property right owner.

-   Unless the notice pertains to copyright or other intellectual property infringement, the Agent will be unable to address the listed concern.

_Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification_

We will notify You that We have removed or disabled access to copyright-protected material that You provided, if such removal is pursuant to a validly received DMCA take-down notice. In response, You may provide Our Agent with a written counter-notification that includes the following information:

-   Your physical or electronic signature;

-   Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;

-   A statement from You under the penalty of perjury, that You have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and

-   Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that You consent to the jurisdiction of a court for the judicial district in which Your physical address is located, or if Your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which We may be located, and that You will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.

_Termination of Infringers_

We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion, to terminate the account or access of any user of the Service who is the subject of repeated DMCA or other infringement notifications.
