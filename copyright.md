For clarity, only copyright infringement notices should go to our Copyright Agent. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your notice may not be valid.

If you believe the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, you may submit a counter-notice to the address listed above containing the following information:

- Your physical or electronic signature;

- Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or a misidentification of the content; and

- Your name, physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of: (1) if such physical address is in the United States, the federal court in which your address is located; or (2) if your physical address is outside of the United States, a federal court in California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed or disabled. If we receive such a notification, we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.
